Continuous integration (CI) is practice that involves developers making small changes and checks to their code. Due to the scale of requirements and the number of steps involved, this process is automated to ensure that teams can build, test, and package their applications in a reliable and repeatable way. CI helps streamline code changes, thereby increasing time for developers to make changes and contribute to improved software.

Continuous delivery (CD) is the automated delivery of completed code to environments like testing and development. CD provides an automated and consistent way for code to be delivered to these environments.

## GitOps

GitOps is a way to manage and operate infrastructure using Git as the single source of truth. It uses Git for continuous delivery and deployment by using Git to version control not only application code but also Infrastructure as Code and deployments.
